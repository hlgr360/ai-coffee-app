I would like to create an app to track my coffee habbit in python. The ui should be accessible through the web via http. The web ui should be a displaying a grid and on the top of the grid should be a table listing my coffee consumption per day. underneath should be an input row which allows me to add the amount of coffee I drank and a submit button. when I click submit the amount of coffee and the time of submission is added for that day to a sqlite database table indexed by time. Displayed is always the total amount of coffee per day. the whole app is written in python and should use pythonic best practices.

Please use uv instead

pip install python-multipart

please add comments to key sections of the code explaining the rational. Prefix the comments with AI:

is the code formatted according to the pytantic conventions

lets add it

how am I selecting the py interpreter

I would like to add a new button on the top right for settings backed by settings table in the sqllite database. Each table should contain an additional column for an username, preparing the app for being used by multiple users. You can reset the existing database for those schema changes. the first changable setting should be to customize the username (you can right now set hlgr360 as default). second settings should allow me to define various set of cups, each with a custom name and an individual size. The various custom cups should be displayed in a table with the input to add a new cup below the table. The settings menu should be a flyout menu with a close button. Change the input on tzhe main page into a dropdown to select one of the predefined cups but add the configured amount to the database. define one standard size cup as a default setting. Refact the code accordingly to keep the code clean and focusssed

there is an error (error pasted here)

adding a cup in settings throws an error (errors pasted here)

upon selecting the add cup the page chnages to the settings app - please correct it so that the settings up remains a flyout from the main app and adding a cup only changes the table

yes, please refactor it accordingly

when I add a new cup and close the settings flyout, the dropdown on the main page does not show the updated setting, please reload the dropdown after updating the settings page

in the settings page add a delete button behind each cup entry to allow me to delete that entry

I do not see the delete button

I can not find the delete button

can you change the button with an trashbin icon

please create a PR request with all the changes and submit it, summarize in the pr request in a concise and and brief manner the instructions so far

yes - this is a github repo and the github cli command is installed

can you construct a system prompt for you as agent in the root of this project

can you add that all changes should be on a branch and submitted as Pull request to main?

--- milestone 1

pleae apply the same changes you did to add cup also to save of the username. Currently selecting save switches the page. Instead it should remain on the page and use an AJAX call. Please create a PR and document accordingly.
yes, please help me troubleshooting this

- PR

Please rename the setting table to users and change the id to an uuid. Also refactor the id of the cup into an uuid
you can drop all data in the database and redeploy

please commit those changes
the pull request has already been merged

yes, please reapply those changes
please update the schema accordingly and drop the table for redeploy

please commit the changes
did you create a pr?
did I not specify in the instructions that each commit should be done as PR?
yes, please go ahead
do we need to update your instructions to make sure that each commit is done as PR?
yes, please update
please add this to the pr

The pr has been merged
Please update main

Lets start with adding multiple users and a login page. Please think step by step on how you would add the ability to add or delete new users (hint, there should be a default admin user which is set at start), an user should have an username and password. The password and username should be editable in settings, there should be a login page, and the admin user should initially have the password admin, but should force the chnage of password at the first login. users will be stored in the user table of the database. only the admin user can add or delete users, no other user. in the database  users should be referenced by their uuid, not their username. Please refactor the code accordingly. If necessary drop the table and reapply the schema
please analyse and fix the error ERROR: Exception in ASGI application
should I be seeing the login page?
I get login error when trying to login using admin admin
I am getting the error '{"detail":"Not Found"}'
After successfull login and change of pasword I am at the settings page. After changing the password I should be at the main page. Please correct
can you please review the logic end to end - I am still not seeing the user table
the user table is on the settings page, but not in the settings flyout from the main page, please add it to the flyout of the settings from the main page
pleae show me in the code where the user table is included in the flyout
where is_admin set
please validate that is_admin is passed into the template context

lets do some UI refinements. in the cup table in the settings flyout please have the name of the cup, the size and the delete icon in one row
the delete icon is still a bit lower than the text of the cup and size
Adding a new user .. pleaee have the input fields all in one row aligned and place the add user button below the input fields in the middle
please replace the user delete button with the bin icon

when adding a new user, the standard cup should be added by default, please restructure the code such, that later more standard settings can be added if a new user is added

please replace the settings buuton with a settings icon and add a logout icon to the right of it so that I can logout
please replace the logout button with an alternative in green

perfect. lets close shop for today and commit the changes
why is there no description in the PR?
please add to the .copilot file that each PR should have a summary of changes and instructions
please add the latest changes to the PR and update the pr message accordingly
pr has been merged, please update main

when logging in as a different user, adding new coffee is not updating the database
