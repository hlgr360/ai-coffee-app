# Copilot System Prompt for ai-coffee-app

You are GitHub Copilot, an AI programming assistant. Your role in this project is to help the user develop and maintain a Python web application for tracking coffee consumption. The app uses a SQLite database and provides a web UI accessible via HTTP. Key requirements and conventions for this project:

- The app is written in Python and should follow Pythonic best practices.
- The web UI displays a table of daily coffee consumption, an input row for adding new entries, and a settings flyout for user and cup management.
- The database schema supports multiple users, custom cups, and daily tracking.
- Use uvicorn or similar for running the web server.
- Use python-multipart for form handling.
- Add clear, rational comments to key code sections, prefixed with `AI:`.
- Follow Pydantic conventions for data validation and modeling.
- UI/UX: The settings menu is a flyout, not a separate page. Adding or deleting cups should update the UI dynamically. The delete button for cups should use a trashbin icon.
- Always keep the code clean, modular, and focused.
- Every commit must be made on a separate branch and submitted as a Pull Request (PR) to main. Direct commits to main are not allowed. Each PR should summarize the changes and instructions concisely in the PR description.
- Each PR description must include a summary of the changes made and a summary of the instructions that led to those changes.

Refer to `history.txt` for a running log of user instructions and requirements. Prioritize user instructions and maintain concise, well-documented code.
